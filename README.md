# Project Title

Palia cooking minigame

## Description

Simple script to help with the 'chopping' during the Palia cooking mini-game.

This script detects when the moving marker enters the chop zone and clicks the mouse button.

I leave the script running while playing and have had no issues.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Mainly pyautogui, however had some issues getting the venv environment set up with a working combination of PyAutoGUI/numpy/pillow

* see requirements.txt

### Installing

Running on 1920x1080 resolution. 
May need to change the location of the detect pixel if your screen resolution is different.

### Executing program

```
python paliacook.py
```
Start palia / cooking / chopping.

Currently only automated chopping is available.


## Help

```
paliacook.py -h
```
